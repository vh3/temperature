# temperature

A science fair project tool intended to collect temperature & time data from multiple DS18B20 sensors immersed in cooling liquids.

Hardware: Raspberry Pi 3 + waterproof DS18B20 waterproof temperature probes + 1 non-waterproof sensor for capture of the ambient temperature.

Software:  We are going to try out tcl, python and swift.  There seems to be a number of libraries available for each.

We used an Adafruit tutorial to get things working:
